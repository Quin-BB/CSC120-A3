Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
    Mackenzie

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
    None (I've yet to need to go and I'm busy during most of the set times)

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    Î™'ve worked in Java before but ina much more controlled environment in high school so while it still felt a bit daunting, I still had experience to draw on.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities 
or the differences between the two languages? 


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    Don't do what I did and spend too much time thinking about the assignment than actually writing the code. Because I have more experience in Python I found myself sometimes writing code in a weird combination of the two languages to just get the thought down before translating it to Java.
